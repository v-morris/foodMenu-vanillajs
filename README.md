# Food Menu
Ordering menu created using JavaScript. Uses getters and setters. Select your item based on "meal time" and add the item to your order by clicking. Pushes the item to an "order" array, and displays on the right side of the screen. Right side also gets sorted while adding items. Customized Bootstrap buttons to experiment on one way it could be done.
